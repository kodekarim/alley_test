The project achieves aÂ 48% unit test code coverage using the MVVM-C architecture.
It utilises the SqueezeNet ML model for picture identification and the Vision framework for text extraction from images.
A crucial feature is the collection view's creative use of prefetching, which allows for ideal image synchronisation between the default photo app and Alley Test.
Notably, it easily manages picture quantities ranging from 10 to 10,000, demonstrating strong scalability and excellent assignment fulfilment.
